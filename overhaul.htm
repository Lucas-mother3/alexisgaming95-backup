					<h2>Introducing: AGR Classic - The Overhaul! (AGRCv2)</h2>
					
					<p>It's been a while, but I finally overhauled my site, hopefully for the better! I wrote this blog post as it didn't seem to fit KibiByte's 200px div element, and it's basically dead for now, so here's what I did for my site!</p>
					
					<h3>Activity Centers: Revitalized</h3>
					
					<p>As you've noticed, I overhauled my website's homepage for a few weeks now. I am actually thinking about the new homepage layout for months actually, the first version of the homepage <b>actually</b> used the original HTML file with modifications due to, one, it used outdated and/or nonexistent specifications, and the second one is the one you've been seeing now. If you want to see the first version, you can look up on the Wayback Machine, or via GitHub or BitBucket until I backed up my site again.</p>

					<h3>Goodbye seperate mobile version, hello responsive layout!</h3>
					
					<p>This is one of the things I was thinking about adding until like in the past 4 days, as it's officially here, a responsive layout, which sadly breaks browsers (which breaks my original intentions) but after using sadgrl's layout builder, recreating my layout manually, and doing stuff like making a pure CSS collapsible list that I found from Google (actually DigitalOcean), but who cares, less work tho. I was thinking of putting the old homepage sometime soon.</p>
					
					<h3>Dark mode is finally here!</h3>
					
					<p>One of the most requested things on my site was add a dark mode, and now you can see my site in dark mode! Please note that I used media queries to do it, so set your whole browser to light mode to see it on the old color scheme. Dark mode is just basically the website but inverted, which surprisingly worked and looked good for me, also I'm still squashing bugs related to Dark Reader. That add-on will break the border's color for the most part and the *totally JS* commentbox, but I'm a maniac so, whatever.</p>
					
					<h3>Some deprecation here and there, and general reception</h3>
					
					<p>Since the website is overhauled, most things would be deprecated until I put it again, such as the guestbook, the wall of infinite buttons, and so much more. I might even put KibiByte Updates back in the right sidebar, so no hope is lost. </p>
					
					<p>As for the general reception? They generally liked it, but I want <b>YOUR</b> own opinion, so that's why there's a box at the top telling you to tell me a feedback in the Freedom Wall. I want you, I'm checking the feed once in a while, so it might take some time.</p>
					
					<h3>The future?</h3>
					
					<p>Well, I'm most likely to stick with it for years, I might change the CSS stylesheet but it's likely more minimal, unless some browser breaks support for some element. I'm also wanting to keep the vibe of being looking like pages in the late 90s, but I am just a regular teenager with a life to go on, but it's unlikely that I might change the vibe. I'm still looking forward to the future of this site, and Neocities as a whole, since I and more people who want to be more indie, relieving the GeoCities era, or both use this website. I might host it here forever, unless Neocities shut down which I might migrate it to something like a tilde community or I decided to host it on my own. Still, the future is looking bright for the website, as we're approaching the end of 2022.</p>
					
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					
					<p>I am working on this continuously for days, with one day not doing at all because of a recent typhoon. Still, I'm asking for your own feedback to the overhaul since I am totally unsure if I should keep it or not. Be serious about your feedbacks, and also I hope you are having a nice day. See ya!</p>
